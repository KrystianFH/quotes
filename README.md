# quotes
- Our app.java is able to read files from a .json file, and then print information. In our specific case, our app is generating authors and quotes by them!

## Process & Documentation
- We utilized FileReader, which reads the Json file called quotes.json. That information is then taken through our constructor to grab the specific information that we want, in our case thats the author and the quote. Next we generated a random number, using that number to grab a random index within our Quotes[]. Then we print that line!

## Time + Space Efficiency
- Time: O(n)
